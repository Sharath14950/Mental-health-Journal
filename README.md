# Mental-health-Journal
The Mental Health Journal App is a Kivy-based tool for tracking daily thoughts. It uses NLTK sentiment analysis to assign moods (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and stores entries in an SQLite database. With a user-friendly interface, splash screen, and plans for mood trend visualization, it empowers users to monitor their mental well-being.
